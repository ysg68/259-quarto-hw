#This project has two raw data files at different scales from a study of
#infants, children, and adults watching a series of 7 video clips

#I wrote Steps 1 and 2 to import and merge the data, and kept them here for your reference
#Skip down to Step 3 to work on EDA

#SOURCE DESCRIPTION

#FILE 1: auc.csv
#Columns =  stim (stimulus video, levels/labels provided below)
#           id (unique participant identifier)
#           age (in days)
#           AUC_sal (area-under-the-curve for a saliency model)
#           AUC_dist (area-under-the-curve for a distance model)
#AUC values indicate how well each model predicted where participants looked 
#when watching a video
#AUC values can range from 0-1 where .5 is chance and 1 is perfect prediction

#FILE 2: participants_info_full_headers.csv
#Columns =  id (unique participant identifier, matches auc.csv)
#           age_group (a categorical age variable with levels:
#             ".5-1 y" "1-1.5 y" "1.5-2 y" "2-4 y" "4-6 y" "8-10 y" "adult" 
#           precision (a quality measure of the eye data, smaller is better)
#           7 columns of "Seen X" the stimulus video before the study
#             coded as SEEN (1), NOT SEEN (2), NOT SURE (3) 


#STEP 1: READ IN THE AUC DATA AND CODE STIM AS A FACTOR 
auc <- read_csv(here("data_raw", "auc_bystim.csv"))

stim_levels <- 1:7
stim_labels <- c("Fallon","Feist","Pentatonix","Science","Rube","Plane","Dogs")
auc <- auc %>% mutate(stim = factor(stim, levels = stim_levels, labels = stim_labels))

#STEP 2: READ IN THE PPT INFO DATA
#Wrangle the ppt info data so that you can merge it into the auc data
#Drop any data where the AUC values are missing
#In the final, merged data, make the "watched" variable is coded as a factor with 
#  levels "seen" (1), "not seen" (2), "not sure" (3) 
#Write the cleaned file to data_cleaned/ 

#Read in the ppt data and rename columns to be easier to work with
ppt <- read_csv(here("data_raw","participants_info_full_headers.csv")) %>% 
  rename(id = `participant ID`,
         age_group = `Age group`,
         precision = "Precision")

#Each question about watching each video is a column, so pivot_longer
#Use separate to get just the video name into it's own column
ppt_long <- ppt %>% pivot_longer(cols = starts_with("Seen"), names_to = "stim", values_to = "watched")
ppt_long <- ppt_long %>% separate(stim, into = c(NA, "stim"))

#Code stim and watched as factors
ppt_long <- ppt_long %>% mutate(
  stim = factor(stim, levels = stim_labels, labels = stim_labels),
  watched = factor(watched, levels = 1:3, labels = c("Yes","No","Not Sure")))

#Join the ppt data to the AUC data (by id and by stim since each participant has observations for each stim)
ds <- left_join(auc, ppt_long, by = c("id", "stim"))
ds <- ds %>% drop_na(AUC_sal:AUC_dist) #Drop participants for whom we don't have data for the DV

#Write the data to file
ds %>% write_csv(here("data_cleaned","cleaned.csv"))

#STEP 3: EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS

#3A PRECISION: Is the precision acceptable (< 2.5) for each participant? 
  #Visualize the distribution of precision to see if there are values above 2.5
  #Create a summary to figure out which participants would we need to exclude if > 2.5 meant the data are unuseable? 
  #Use a summary table and plots to investigate whether data equally precise for participants of different ages

#Visualize the distribution of precision to see if there are values above 2.5
ds %>% ggplot(aes(x = precision)) + geom_histogram() + geom_vline(xintercept = 2.5)

#Create a summary to figure out which participants would we need to exclude if > 2.5 meant the data are unuseable? 
ds %>% group_by(id, age_group) %>% 
  summarize(precision = mean(precision, na.RM = T)) %>% 
  filter(precision > 2.5)

ds %>% filter(precision > 2.5)

#Use a summary table and plots to investigate whether data equally precise for participants of different ages
ds %>% group_by(age_group) %>% summarize(across(precision, list(M = mean, MIN = min, MAX = max)))

ds %>% ggplot(aes(x = age_group, y = precision)) + geom_boxplot() + geom_hline(yintercept = 2.5)
ds %>% ggplot(aes(x = age, y = precision)) + geom_point() + geom_hline(yintercept = 2.5)

#3B AGE: Are there any errors in age? 
#Convert age to years so that it can be more easily compared to age_group
#Visualize age in years by age_group to see whether participants are the correct age for their group
#Make a summary table of age in years by age group to check whether all participants' ages are correct

#Convert age to years so that it can be more easily compared to age_group
ds <- ds %>% mutate(age_years = age/365.25)

#Visualize age in years by age_group to see whether participants are the correct age for their group
ds %>% group_by(id, age_group) %>% 
  summarize(age_years = mean(age_years)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(y = age_group, x = age_years)) + geom_boxplot()

#Another option would be to facet by age group and to let the scales be "free" to get a better look
ds %>% group_by(id, age_group) %>% 
  summarize(age_years = mean(age_years)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(y = age_years)) + 
  geom_boxplot() + 
  facet_wrap("age_group", scales = "free")

#Make a summary table of age in years by age group to check whether all participants' ages are correct
ds %>% group_by(age_group) %>% summarize(min_age = min(age_years), max_age = max(age_years))
